We will meet weekly during normal class times in order to get the project finished efficiently, either online together through discord or in-person during the week. We will work together during class time, as well as assign individual work and research for the project for the week. 

We will code in Java using netBeans throughout the duration of the project. We will target desktop using mp3 files to play music from the usersâ€™ own files.
